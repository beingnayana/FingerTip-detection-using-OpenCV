# Finger-tip-detection

**Requirements**  
1.QT Creator
2. OpenCV  
**Description**  
In this modern world security has big importance so using the fingerprints for locking a system is the best method. In the morket we have lot of fingerprint detecting machine but we need a new system which can detect the finger print without any contact. So in this project I am designing a contactless fingertip detector using the most pwerful open library OpenCV. OpenCV is a very powerful library for images in this new world. As openCV is more compitable with C++ I have used C++ for making the project in QT creator.   
**Steps**  
1. Capturing the hand image using the webcam and convert it into the grey scale colorspace and apply the algorithm specified in the paper.  2. Apply filters to remove the noise and find the countours in the image.
